# Software Development Tools

# Market of used cars


## Description of the Project:
In this project, we analyze a dataset containing car sales advertisements. Our objectives include performing exploratory data analysis, creating data visualizations, and developing a web application dashboard. The dashboard serves as a simulation tool, allowing users to explore how various factors impact car prices.

## Project Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly web application that helps users understand the relationships between car attributes and prices. 

## Tools and Libraries:
-	Python: Use Python programming language for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
-	Pandas: Manipulate and preprocess the data efficiently.
- Plotly: Create visualizations and charts for data exploration and presentation.
- Numpy: Utilize NumPy for numerical computations and array manipulation.
- GitHub: Leveraged GitHub for version control and collaborative development.
- Streamlit: Developed interactive and user-friendly web applications for data visualization and analysis.
- Render: Utilized Render for hosting and deploying web applications and data projects.
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Employed VS Code as the integrated development environment (IDE) for coding and project management.
