# Data Visualization with Python

# Squirrel Diet


## Description of the Project:
For this  project we’ve been provided with a dataset and a figure. Our job is to use either seaborn or plotly to recreate the figure using the dataset.
The dataset contains the results of a mock study where 100 red squirrels were given one of three different diets after weaning, and their full grown adult weights were recorded. 

## Project Goal:
The goal of the project is to recreate given figure.

## Tools and Libraries:
-	Python: Use Python programming language for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
-	Pandas: Manipulate and preprocess the data efficiently.
-	Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly: Create visualizations and charts for data exploration and presentation.
