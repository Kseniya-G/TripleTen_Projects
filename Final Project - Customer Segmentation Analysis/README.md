# Customer Analysis - Segmentation of Customers for AtliQ Hardware


## Description of the Problem:
AtliQ Hardware is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India, and has even expanded into other countries as well. They sell different types of hardware to big players such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.
This year, they're asking PWC to conduct a big audit of their sales and help them automate their existing data.
The clients are particularly interested in three business areas:
- Financial Analysis: Revenue/Profits/Margin Change Research How have revenue/profits changed over time? How has the market shifted? What categories are most profitable?…
- Product Analysis Which items are the bestsellers? How can the company improve its sales? How has popularity changed over time/across markets?…
- Customer Analysis Segmentation of customers: who are they and what do they buy? How can we improve business with them?…

## Customer Analysis:
Considering the nature of AtliQ Hardware's business and the potential for improving their overall performance and sales, I believe the very important analysis to focus on is "Customer Analysis - Segmentation of Customers." Understanding the customer base and their buying behavior is crucial for tailoring marketing strategies, optimizing product offerings, and improving customer satisfaction, which can ultimately lead to increased revenue and profits.

## Project Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive customer analysis for AtliQ Hardware, with the aim of gaining valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and purchasing patterns. By achieving this goal, the project aims to achieve the following objectives:
1. Identify and define primary customer segments based on platform, channel, and region.
2. Analyze and compare customer segments in terms of their purchase frequency, value, revenue contribution, and profitability.
3. Determine the characteristics of high-value customers and provide recommendations to enhance business relationships with them.
4. Explore the evolution of customer purchasing behavior over time and across different markets.
5. Identify the most popular product categories among different customer segments.
6. Investigate the key factors influencing customer loyalty, repeat purchases, and retention for each customer segment.
7. Evaluate the revenue contribution of each customer segment to the overall business.
8. Identify untapped customer segments with growth potential and recommend strategies for business expansion.
9. Identify specific customer segments with high growth potential that the company can target for business expansion.
