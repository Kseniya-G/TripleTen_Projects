# Manhattan Vacation Rental Market Analysis


### Description of the Problem:
In this consalting project, we will  assist a client in making informed decisions about investing in vacation rental properties within the Manhattan borough of New York City. The client is interested in investing in several properties but would like some guidance on what types of properties they should be targeting. 
We will analyze data collected on current Airbnb listings to identify useful insights.
The client seeks help in prioritizing their research by answering the following questions:
- Which type of properties should be targeted?
- Which neighborhoods are most attractive for vacation rentals?
- Which size properties (i.e., how many bedrooms) are most popular for vacation rentals?
- Whatâ€™s the average occupancy for each listing?
- Which days of the week have the highest occupancy rates?
- Estimate revenue for an investment property.
- What attributes are important for a vacation rental (e.g., superhost status, presence of doormen)?

### Project Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to provide our client with data-driven insights and recommendations that will enable them to make well-informed decisions regarding their investment in Manhattan vacation rental properties. By addressing the questions above and conducting a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb data, we aim to provide strategic guidance that maximizes our client's return on investment and ensures the success of their vacation rental projects.
