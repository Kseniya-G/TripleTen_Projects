# Saving SuperStore 2 - The Causes of Returns


## Description of the Project:
As a consultant working with SuperStore, this project is focused on conducting an analysis to uncover the reasons behind the high volume of returned orders. The aim is to provide valuable insights to the SuperStore's CEO, helping them understand the factors contributing to returns and develop strategies to reduce return rates.

By analyzing various dimensions of the data, we aim to answer critical questions:
- What is the relationship between total sales and total returns? Do higher sales always lead to higher returns?
- Which product categories experience the highest return rates?
- Are there specific customer segments that are more likely to make returns?
- Is there a geographical concentration of returned orders, and does return rate vary by state?
- Is there a seasonal pattern to returned orders by month?
- What insights can we derive from return rates concerning state, year, product category, and ship mode?

## Project Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to identify the root causes of returned orders within SuperStore's operations and create an informative and interactive dashboard to present our findings, providing a clear visualization of the analysis.

### Tools and Libraries:
- Tableau: Utilize Tableau for data visualization and analysis.
