# Mobile Plan Classifier

## Description of the Problem:
Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. 


## Project Goal:
The goal of the project to develop a model that will pick the right plan, a model with the highest possible accuracy. 

In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75. Check the accuracy using the test dataset.  


## Tools and Libraries:
-	Python: Use Python programming language for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
-	Pandas: Manipulate and preprocess the data efficiently.
-	Matplotlib, Seaborn: Create visualizations and charts for data exploration and presentation.
-   Scikit-Learn (Sklearn): Model training, evaluation, and selection.


## Data Documentation:
Every observation in the dataset contains monthly behavior information about one user. The information given is as follows: 
- `'сalls'` — number of calls,
- `'minutes'` — total call duration in minutes,
- `'messages'` — number of text messages,
- `'mb_used'` — Internet traffic used in MB,
- `'is_ultra'` — plan for the current month (Ultra - 1, Smart - 0).
