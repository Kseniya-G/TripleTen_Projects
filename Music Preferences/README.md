# Python Fundamentals

# Music Preferences

### Description of the Project:
 Whenever we're performing analysis, we need to formulate hypotheses that we can then test. Sometimes we accept these hypotheses; other times, we reject them. To make the right decisions, a business must be able to understand whether or not it's making the right assumptions.
In this project, we'll compare the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. we'll look at real Yandex.Music data to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior for these two cities.
We aim to uncover user behavior patterns and draw insightful comparisons.

### Project Goal:
Test three hypotheses:

1. User activity differs depending on the day of the week and from city to city.
2. On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shelbyville residents listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday evenings.
3. Springfield and Shelbyville listeners have different preferences. In Springfield, they prefer pop, while Shelbyville has more rap fans.

### Tools and Libraries:
-	Python: Use Python programming language for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
-	Pandas: Manipulate and preprocess the data efficiently.

### Data Documentation:
- `'userID'`— user identifier
- `'Track'` — track title
- `'artist'` — artist's name
- `'genre'` — genre of music 
- `'City'` — user's city
- `'time'` — the exact time the track was played
- `'Day'` — day of the week
